Finding turkey cities game with python

This is simple city finder game in turkey implemented in python. There are 2 files in the project. These are respectively;  

**main.py:** It is our main file. We set the picture to be displayed on the screen. In the loop, we constantly ask the user for a city estimate and increase the score with each correct answer.  

**il.csv:** In this file, there are the names of the provinces and their coordinates to be placed on the map.  

We are trying to find the provinces of Turkey in a blank map. These provinces are positioned on the map in correct predictions. The game is over when all provinces are found.
